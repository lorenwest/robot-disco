Robot Disco
===========

A discovery protocol for robots in a local area network.

Once robots discover each other, they can communicate using the [cppp-io](https://github.com/hybridgroup/cppp-io) robot protocol.

JavaScript - The NodeJS implementation lives at http://github.com/lorenwest/robot-disco-js
